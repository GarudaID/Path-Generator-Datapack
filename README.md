The Path Generator Datapack will automatically convert ground below you every few game ticks to a dirt block and later to a path block if you walk over it. This allows the dirt to grow back into grass if you do not want a path to be created there. Over time, your walking routes will grow into connected trails as an immersive survival feature.
